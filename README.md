# Rock-paper-scizzor
Making a js text based game rock , paper &amp; scizzor game. 

I wrote a basic javascript code for rock paper scissor.
The game generates on its own. 
Both player get infinite turns and the rules are:
 1. The basic rock-paper-scizzor rules are same. Rock wins Scizzor,
 Scizzor wins Paper and so on...
 2. Whoever wins get 1 point and draw = 0.
 3. Whoever get 5 wins first is the winner.
